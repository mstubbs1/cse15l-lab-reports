**Questions**  
1. A simple way to fix the bug is to check if any of the brackets or parenthesis are infront of backticks. With a closed backtick and open backtick variable. 
2. This is a pretty involved change to implement in order to fix the bug because it requires nowing if the link is nested, which requires basically a compelete rework of the code, checking to see if the link is nested in between 2 brackets. This change would most likely require more than ten lines.
3.  In order to fix the failures, it's necessary to check if theire are line breaks within the brackets and parenthesis. It wouldn't be a large fix and it could be done with less than ten lines.
