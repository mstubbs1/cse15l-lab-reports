# Hello Future CSE15L Students 
Today I will be guiding you on how to use your course specific account on the `ieng6` server.

**Disclaimer** : This guide will be centered around **MacOS**, so this tutorial is assuming that you will be using **MacOS** as there is a pretty large difference on how to do this if you're using a windows pc or a mac.

## Firstly... 
You need to have Visual Studio Code installed. To do this, go to the [Visual Studio Code Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and downlad the version for your corresponding operating system. *Again, this guide will be focusing on doing all of this on MacOS*.

Once you have successfully installed visual studio code onto your Mac, you can create a new instance of the terminal by clicking `Terminal `> ` New Terminal` at the top of your display.

## Now That You Have a Terminal

You can connect to your `ieng6` account. Do this by typing in the terminal `ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` With the "zz" replaced by your 2-3 unique  characters that can be found in your course directory. The link for that can be found [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Once you type the command into the terminal, make sure to type "yes" when it asks you permission to continue connecting to the host.

*While this screenshot was taken in windows powershell, it's the exact same on a mac terminal.*

## Testing Some Commands 

An important command to note is `ls`. This command stands for "list files" and list all the files in the directory you are currently in.
